    <string name="Hepatitis_B">
        The main objective of hepatitis B immunization strategies is to prevent chronic
        HBV infection and its serious consequences, including liver cirrhosis and HCC.
        Sri Lanka introduced Hepatitis B vaccine into National Immunization schedule in
        year 2003 (on a phased basis) in the form of liquid monovalent vaccine. With the
        introduction of Hib vaccine in year 2008, Hep B vaccine is given in the form of
        liquid pentavalent vaccine (DTP-HepB+Hib).

    <string name="Rotavirus">
        According to the rotavirus surveillance conducted by the Epidemiology Unit at
        tertiary care settings (Lady Ridgway Hospital) in Sri Lanka, the proportion of
        rotavirus diarrhoea among all-cause diarrhoeal admissions in children under five
        years of age was 23.9%. The reported mortality associated with rotavirus infections
        in Sri Lanka is very low. Although rotavirus diarrhoea patients were hospitalized
        throughout the year, the observed rotavirus peak was from January to
        March and was consistent with the pattern of increase in all cause diarrhoeal admissions.
        The most common G types detected in Sri Lanka were G3(32%) and
        G9(30%) while the predominant P type was P8 (58%).

        Fortunately, Haemophilus influenzae b disease (Hib) is preventable. Vaccines are the
        only public health tool capable of preventing the majority of cases of serious Hib
        disease. There is a highly safe and effective vaccine routinely used in the industrialized
        world for over 15 years in their childhood immunization programmes and
        has documented virtual elimination of Hib disease. Despite recommendations
        from WHO that Hib vaccine be included in all countries’ routine infant immunization
        programmes, in 2006, only 26% of children worldwide received Hib vaccine.
